# Welcome to my new blog!

Hi, I’m Tamas.

I’ve spent the last 8+ years working in data analytics — building dashboards, writing SQL, defining KPIs, and sitting in countless meetings where the number one request was:
“How can I export this to Excel?”

## What I Actually Do

I’m a Data Analyst. A Data Visualization Expert. A Business Intelligence Consultant.
Sometimes a Business Analyst. Sometimes a junior Data Engineer.

In this field, you wear a lot of hats.

In practice, I:

- Write complex SQL across multiple databases (PostgreSQL, Oracle, and BigQuery)
- Build decision-focused dashboards in Tableau, Power BI, and QlikSense
- Translate vague business questions into measurable KPIs
- Improve data models and backend structures when needed
- Help stakeholders understand what’s actually possible with BI tools

## Why This Blog Exists

Most dashboards fail for the same reasons:

- Too many metrics
- Too many data sources
- Weak data modeling
- No clear understanding of business requirements
- No real business impact

Data visualization is not just about fancy charts.

It’s a structured, visual way of presenting complex information in a way that’s easy to understand.

This blog documents how I approach:

- Dashboard design
- Data storytelling
- SQL optimization
- KPI frameworks

## What You’ll Find Here

### Real Projects
Public datasets. Honest breakdowns. Clear reasoning.

### Design Thinking
Why this chart?
Why this layout?
Why this filter?
What problem does it actually solve?

### Backend Perspective
Every good dashboard starts in the database.

Data modeling and query performance matter more than color palettes.

## My Goal

To share what I’ve learned as a data analyst — and yes, occasionally show you how to export the report to Excel.

This blog is a public record of that journey.

If you're interested in:

- Data visualization best practices
- Tableau or Power BI development
- Writing better SQL
- Building dashboards that actually influence decisions


You’re in the right place.
